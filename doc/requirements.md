# Final Project

idea: library program ("Library Management System")
- add book data via cli
- store book data in files
- query & print items by category
- print a sorted list of items from category
- overdue fines (for arithmetic) (?)
- store data in xml files (for File Algorithms)
    - Use [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml). It's simple, fast, and cross-platform. Also, it's all native C++, so I can save it with my code.
    - A good reason for implementing this, is that I can add seed data

1. Collect book data from cli, and save it to a file
2. List all books
3. List books by subject (sorted)
4. overdue fines?
5. help text
